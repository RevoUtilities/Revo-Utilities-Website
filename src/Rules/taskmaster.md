# Taskmaster for Revo Utilities

## Current Overview

- **Project Name:** Revo Utilities
- **Location:** /Users/daniel/Documents/Bolt Apps/Revo Utilities
- **Overview:** This project hosts a web application with various utilities. The codebase includes core application logic, configuration files, and UI components.

## Using Taskmaster

When you use the prompt "Start Taskmaster", the following automated process will begin:

1. **Codebase Analysis:** Taskmaster will scan the current project structure and files to determine the state of the codebase
2. **Task Progress Review:** Evaluate which tasks have been completed and which are still pending
3. **Next Steps Identification:** Based on task dependencies and priorities, identify the next logical tasks to work on
4. **Recommendations:** Provide specific suggestions for implementing the next task, including files to modify and approaches to consider

This allows you to quickly resume work without having to repeat instructions or manually determine what needs to be done next.
