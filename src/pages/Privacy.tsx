                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  The cookies we and our business partners use on our Site are broadly grouped into the following categories:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>Essential</strong> – Some of the cookies on our Site are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of this could be a cookie used to enable you to log into your account on our Site or which allows communication between your browser and our Site. Our cookie preference cookie described in the section &quot;How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?&quot; is also an essential cookie. You may not be able to use our Site without these cookies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Analytics</strong> – We use analytics cookies to helps us understand how users engage with our Site. An example is counting the number of different people coming to our Site or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or feature is used. Without this cookie, if you visited our Site once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We would find it difficult to analyse how well our Site was performing and improve it without these cookies.</li>
                  <li><strong>User Cookies</strong> – We use cookies to improve your experience by remembering your preferences so we know how you like to use our Site. Examples of this would be remembering you so that you are served with the same content or to remember you when you come back to our Site.</li>
                  <li><strong>Social Sharing</strong> – We use third party cookies to allow you to share content directly on the social networking/sharing sites like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Examples would be if you wanted to &quot;like&quot; or &quot;tweet&quot; about us or our products or services. Please see our &quot;Third Party Cookies&quot; section below for more details.</li>
                  <li><strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong> – You will have noticed that when you visit websites you will be shown adverts for products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by website owners for showing third party adverts on their websites often pays for the cost of running the website and therefore usually allows you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. To try and ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you third party cookies may be used to collect information about the types of things that interest you, for example websites you visit and the geography that you are based in. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts you see more relevant. Please see our &quot;Third Party Cookies&quot; section below for more details.</li>
